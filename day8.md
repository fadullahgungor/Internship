## **DAY8**


Today, I searched MongoDB, and found some good tutorials. I have looked at them.  

I learnt some basics like

* how I create database.
* how I create collections.
* how I insert, update, delete collections. 

**PS1:** I have so little experince with terminal. Since mongodb runs with terminal, it's good that I learn new things. I believe, I will be got used to it in a few days.
