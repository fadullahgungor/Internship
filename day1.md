## **DAY1**

Hi, today is my first day in the company. When I first came here, I talked with [Tolga Kaprol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tolgakaprol/?ppe=1) who is engineer in this company 
which is called [TR.net](http://tr.net/) . We talked about a lot of things such as importance of Docker Technology, Openstack and python. It was good speach,opened my horizon. He gave me some duties, like writing first day of this internship diary in this platform, learning how to use github and one more task
for today which is learning PEP20 (20 python enhancement proposals) and writing it into a new github gist.  


What I learnt by following github tutorials? ( from [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) )

I learnt;

*how to create a repository.

*how to start a branch and manage it.

*how to pull request and see changes with original branch.

*how to create a gist and publish it.
