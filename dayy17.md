## **DAY17**

Today, I am tasked to search some GSM/GPRS modules, what types of them in market and what features they have. This research is actually
part of our earthquake project. Because, those sensors that I searched before can not communicate without these GSM/GPRS modules. Therefore,
this task is as a continuation of the previous task.


PS: Surprisingly I found this [news](http://www.ntv.com.tr/turkiye/prof-dr-ercan-2033e-kadar-marmara-depremi-beklenmiyor,ScgghM6rZkyOC0UfgFDynQ), while I work on earthquakes.
