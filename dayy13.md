## **DAY13**

Today, I completed my research and made a presentation about Earthquake Detection Studies. You can reach from [this link](https://github.com/fadullahgungor/Internship/blob/master/Deprem%20Proje.pdf). I learnt 3 measurement systems and I searched 2 tools for each of them. I compared them according to their features and made a research project.
