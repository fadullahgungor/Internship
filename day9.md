## **DAY9**

Today I was working on MongoDB more deeply. [Tolga Kaprol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tolgakaprol/?ppe=1) and [Banu Üşenmez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/banu-usenmez-0b25059/) who are working on IOT communication protocols, came to me and gave a duty. My task is examining some seismographic sensors. To do that, first I have to learn some basics about eartquake. Therefore, I am reading a report about **Anticipation and Detection of Earthquake**.   You can reach the file from [this link] (https://github.com/fadullahgungor/Internship/blob/master/Deprem.pdf).
