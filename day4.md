## **DAY4**

Day 4 has just started and as I said, I will be preparing a presentation with Marp for tomorrow. Presentation will be based on two
programming languages which are **kotlin** and **java**. 

Update at finishing: 

Today I searched Kotlin programming language and how it is seperated from Java. I also learnt why Google supported JetBrains based this language. I made a presentation about it which you can reach from sunum.md file.
