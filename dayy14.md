## **DAY14**

As I said yesterday, I finished my presentation ang gave that report to my in charge engineer. When I came to office, I saw that my
partner were not able to finish his duty. She was working on IOT Communication Protocols. Therefore, she asked me to help her and I helped
her on preparing her presentation. I searched Thread Network Protocol.

**PS:**Thread is an IPv6-based, closed-documentation, royalty-free networking protocol for Internet of Things (IoT) "smart" home automation
devices to communicate on a local wireless mesh network.
