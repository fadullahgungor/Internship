## **DAY11**

Today, I started to search some sensors for the project that company works on. I am in the team for that project. I have tasked to 
search 3 main earthquake sensors. 

* Rodon Gas Sensors
* Metan Gas Sensor
* Seismic Sensor

**PS:** Project is a Research and Development project. I was very surprised when I heard worth of the project. It's 1.5 million dollar project.
