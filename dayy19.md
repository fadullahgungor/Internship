## **DAY19**

Today,I wondered how people were communicating before GSM and I found that there were cables goes all over the telephone lines. Before GSM, there was analog telephone system. It is a modular system that provides communication via centrally connected cables. In this system, it was not enough safe and fast, therefore GSM was developed.
