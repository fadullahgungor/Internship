## **DAY3**


Today I am planning to continue the job I couldn't finish yesterday which is python programming tutorials. After that, if I have time I want to get prepared for my presentation which will be on Friday.  

Update at finishing:

I finally finished my all tutorials and downloaded a program which is [marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/). It is a markdown presentation writer. I am planning to prepare my presention this night and tomorrow. 

I noticed some main differences that I want to share between java and python.

* PS1: In python, a subclass can inherit from more than one parentclass which doesn't exist in java.
* PS2: __ init __(self) for construction method (two underscores) unlike java, because we were using same name with that class's name.
