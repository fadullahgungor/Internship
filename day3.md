## **DAY3**


Helloooo Dear Diary, today I am planning to continue the job I couldn't finish yesterday which is python programming tutorials. After that, if I have time I want to get prepared for my presentation which will be on Friday.  

UPDATE: 

PS1: In python, a subclass can inherit from more than one parentclass which doesnt exist in java.
PS2: __init__(self) for construction (two underscores)
