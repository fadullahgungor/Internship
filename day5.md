Today is the last day of my first week. I will be presenting this afternoon. Also I had been working in another room from other interns,  but today I joined to them. There is another engineer here, his name is [Mesut Ayg√ºn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mesut-aygun-b96027a0/?ppe=1). He is in charge with the interns. Therefore, from now on I will be working with him.
