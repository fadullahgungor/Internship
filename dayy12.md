## **DAY12**

Today, I searched 3 main earthquake sensors and some sample products to them. I am planning to make a presentation about them. According to the researches, there are some anomalies(radon gas anomaly, methane gas anomaly, etc.) before and after the earthquake. For that reason, there are some measuring instruments for detecting radon and methane gas level.
