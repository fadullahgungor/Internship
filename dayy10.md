## **DAY10**

I kept reading the article called [**Anticipation and Detection of Earthquake**](https://github.com/fadullahgungor/Internship/blob/master/Deprem.pdf). I learnt some spesific things about earthquake, sometimes I watched some documentories when I didn't understand exactly, or searched some spesific terms that I don't know.
