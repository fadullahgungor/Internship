## **DAY7**

As my in charge engineer recommended, I downloaded mongoDB to my computer. This year, we took Database Management System course, so that it will be beneficial I guess. From now on, I will be working on MongoDB couple of days. MongoDB is a non relational database, it's a noSql type. Therefore it's not slow as other relational databases.
