## **DAY20**

Today, we had weekly meeting. Banu HanÄ±m came and asked us about what we are doing. I said, I was searching GSM modules, and she explained something. For example, she said that all the base station would be removed, instead of them, there will be some systems like E band and W band. In order to examine all these new technologies, she gave us some usefull reports. After this GSM module task, I guess we will be doing something related to it.
