## **DAY2**

First thing when I came to office, I downloaded pycharm ide to learn python programming language. It's going well right now. Let's see 
how it's going to be continuing.

Update at finishing:

I followed a well known youtuber's videos which is [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEA1FEF17E1E5C0DA), it consist of 43 videos. I came till 30th, I couldn't finish because when the time goes, I got bored but I learnt a lot of things in python. It's more practical than java. There are some differences in each syntax, but logic is the same.

* **PS1**: Since I got used to put semicolon at the end of line in java, I kept going in python mistakenly and got errors.
* **PS2**: One thing was surprised me, we can't use Turkish letters even in comments. Therefore, mostly I got errors for using Turkish letters in py files.
* **PS3**: Since we don't have curly brackets in python(indeed we have for dictionaries), we need to be very carefull when we work on if,while and for things. IDE understands according to alignments of highlighted words.
