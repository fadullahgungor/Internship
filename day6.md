## **DAY6**

Since, we couldn't finish all presentations on Friday, I had to present today. I explained Kotlin to my internship friends and 
in charge engineer.

I mentioned;

* What Kotlin is.
* Why Google supported it for Android programming.
* What's the difference between Java.

On the other hand, today was good to hear something out of technical stuff. [Mesut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mesut-aygun-b96027a0/?ppe=1)
abi did a great speech about life. He said every person is matter, which I strongly believe.
